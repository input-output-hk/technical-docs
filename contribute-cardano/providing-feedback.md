# Providing Feedback

User feedback is an invaluable and critical aspect of Cardano. Regardless of your experience level, we want to hear about any bugs or usability issues you encounter, or any suggestions for improvement you may have.

Please raise an issue in the relevant component repository to provide feedback, including as much detail as possible to help our team understand what went wrong or what we could do better.

We cannot guarantee that feedback provided by other means such as Twitter, Telegram, or the Cardano Forums will be received or actioned, due to the high volume of activity on these channels.
